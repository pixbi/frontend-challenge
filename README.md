# The front-end challenge: animalcules.

Our front-end coding challenge is relatively simple and quite open-ended, which
we hope will inspire creative solutions that go above and beyond the somewhat
abstract problem we propose. These are the problem's requisites:

* You must create a 50px by 50px div - let's call it an animalcule - that moves in a 
  linear (or non-linear) trajectory within a webpage and exhibits the behavior of 
  bouncing off any wall it touches.
* When this div receives a click/touch event, it must clone itself, and the clone
  must possess all the properties of the original div. Additionally, you could
  make the div's progeny "mutate" when cloning occurs. The idea behind what "mutation" 
  means in this context should come from your own creativity!
* Include any additional features that you think would make your project exceedingly awesome. Surprise us.

These are our caveats:

* You can't use canvas or webGL.
* You can't use any libraries.
* You can't employ the use of IBM's Watson supercomputer.
